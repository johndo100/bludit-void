# Yet Another Bludit Docker Image

This Docker container what I'm trying to do with other Linux distro for more update and reducing the image size.

Original work is [here](https://github.com/bludit/docker).

Build from Dockerfile by docker or buildah.

It powered by:
- [Void](https://voidlinux.org)
- [Bludit](https://www.bludit.com)
- [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay)

Other version with [Tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini) init will be availabe soon.
