# Yet Another Bludit Docker Image

This Docker container is what I'm trying to do with other Linux distro for more update and reducing the image size.

Original work is [here](https://github.com/bludit/docker).

Build from Dockerfile by docker or buildah.

It powered by:
- [Void](https://voidlinux.org)
- [Bludit](https://www.bludit.com)
- [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay)

~~~Other version with [Tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini) init will be availabe soon.~~~

A [dinit](https://gitlab.com/tozd/dinit) will be updated when [dinit](https://gitlab.com/tozd/dinit) has been stable.

Tested by [Podman](https://podman.io) on [Void (Linux)](https://voidlinux.org) desktop.
